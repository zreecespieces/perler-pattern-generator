## How Perler Beads Work

Perler beads (also known as Hama beads or melty beads) are small, colorful plastic beads that are arranged on a pegboard to create designs. Once the design is complete, it's ironed to fuse the beads together. This app helps you convert regular images into pixel art patterns that can be recreated with perler beads.
