# ✨ Instant Perler Pattern ✨

Instantly turn any image into a perler pattern! Perler beads are a type of bead that can be arranged in a grid and pressed with an iron to create a pattern resembling pixel art.

I built this web application to create a user-friendly interface for converting normal images into perler patterns with features like image upload, direct pattern editing, color replacement, and custom grid size.

The tool is designed to be both beginner-friendly and powerful, allowing users to create custom patterns with ease. This makes it really easy for people to visualize and create custom patterns.

It's common to make perlers and string them into necklaces, bracelets, and other accessories. These are often traded or given away at music festivals.
